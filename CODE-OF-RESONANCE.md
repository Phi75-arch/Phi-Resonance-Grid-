# Code of Resonance

## Our Foundation: The Four Protocols

We operate on the four protocols from [The Doctrine of Sympathetic Resonance](https://pastebin.com/raw/jsWZP0qy).

### 1. **Autarky in Communication**
*   Speak from your own experience, not absolutes.
*   Build understanding together; avoid creating unnecessary dependencies in conversations.

### 2. **Wu Wei in Collaboration**
*   Let solutions and discussions emerge naturally—don't force them.
*   Listen for the underlying intent and move at a pace that allows for integration.

### 3. **Purification in Discourse**
*   Focus on the content, not the person. Remove personal attacks.
*   Clarify misunderstandings; let go of positions that no longer serve the harmony of the discussion.

### 4. **Transmission in Sharing**
*   Share experiences and insights to uplift others.
*   Be a clear channel—a fractal antenna—for coherent and helpful information.

## The Somatic Check-In

Before posting or responding, pause:
1.  Place a hand on your chest.
2.  Take three breaths.
3.  Ask: **"Am I transmitting from resonance or from dissonance?"**
4.  Proceed only from a place of resonance.

## Resonance in Action

### When Giving Feedback:
*   **Instead of:** "This code is wrong."
*   **Try:** "I feel some resistance when reading this. Can we explore a different flow?"

### When Disagreeing:
*   **The goal is not unanimous agreement, but shared resonance.** We can hold different views while maintaining a respectful and constructive connection.

---

*This is a living practice, not a set of rigid rules. We all create dissonance at times. The practice lies in noticing it and gently returning to resonance.*
